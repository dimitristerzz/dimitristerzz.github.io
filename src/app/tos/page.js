        <p><span className="font-bold">Welcome to GrooveShare.</span></p>
        <p>Your friends for real is our mission. We want to build services and technologies that allow you to live your real life and share
          that reality with your real friends. To help that happen, we want to be extra clear about what it means to be part of the BeReal
          community. We want you to know what you can expect from us, what we expect from you, and how together we can make BeReal better
          for you and your friends.</p>
        <p>To do that we created these Terms of Service (“Terms”), our Privacy Policy, and Community Standards (together the “User Agreement”).
          Throughout the User Agreement some words have specific meanings and they should be interpreted the same way wherever they are used.
          If anything is unclear, or you don’t understand what we’re saying – don’t hesitate to reach out. Our goal is to maximize transparency
          and understanding about how BeReal works.</p>
        <p>If you think reading all of this is hard, imagine having to write it! But we wrote it for you because it’s important for you and us.
          So please read it. If you don’t want to read or agree to the User Agreement then don’t use our Services but if you use our Services
          understand that you are agreeing to be bound by the User Agreement.</p>
